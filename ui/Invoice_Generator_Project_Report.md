## Chapter 2: System Requirement Analysis

### a. Current System Study

The current system for managing export documentation operates primarily through manual processes:

1. Export staff use Microsoft Excel and Word templates to create documents
2. Data is manually entered into each document separately
3. Calculations for weights, quantities, and prices are performed manually
4. Documents are printed, reviewed, and signed physically
5. Archive copies are stored both digitally and physically
6. Updates to documents require creating new versions from scratch
7. No centralized system for tracking document history exists
8. Document retrieval relies on file naming conventions and manual organization

### b. Weakness of Current System

The current manual documentation system suffers from several significant weaknesses:

1. **Data Redundancy:** The same information must be entered repeatedly across multiple documents.
  
2. **Error Proneness:** Manual data entry and calculations frequently lead to errors that require time-consuming corrections.

3. **Time Consumption:** Creating a complete set of export documents can take several hours per shipment.

4. **Inconsistency:** Documents created separately often contain slight variations in common data fields.

5. **Limited Traceability:** Tracking changes and maintaining document history is challenging.

6. **Resource Intensive:** Requires significant staff time that could be allocated to higher-value tasks.

7. **Scaling Issues:** As export volume grows, the manual system becomes increasingly unwieldy.

8. **Format Rigidity:** Adapting document formats to meet different customer or country requirements is difficult.

9. **Knowledge Dependency:** The system depends heavily on experienced staff who understand the documentation requirements.

10. **Delayed Processing:** Documentation errors can lead to shipping delays and customer dissatisfaction.

### c. Problem Identification / Definition

Based on the analysis of the current system, the following key problems have been identified:

1. **Inefficient Data Management:** Lack of a centralized data repository leads to redundant data entry and inconsistencies.

2. **Manual Calculation Errors:** Weights, measurements, and pricing calculations are prone to human error.

3. **Document Consistency Issues:** Maintaining consistency across related export documents is challenging.

4. **Time and Resource Drain:** Manual documentation consumes excessive staff time and company resources.

5. **Limited Collaboration:** The current system doesn't facilitate efficient collaboration between departments.

6. **Scaling Limitations:** The manual system cannot efficiently handle increasing export volumes.

7. **Historical Data Management:** Retrieving and referencing previous shipment documentation is cumbersome.

8. **Compliance Risk:** Manual errors can lead to compliance issues with international trade regulations.

## Chapter 3: System Design

### I. Database Design

#### i. Data Dictionary

The data dictionary provides a detailed description of each data element used in the Invoice Generator application. It includes information such as data type, format, constraints, and relationships with other data elements. This ensures consistency and clarity in data management across the application.

#### ii. Entity-Relationship Diagram

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) visually represents the database structure of the Invoice Generator application. It illustrates the entities involved, their attributes, and the relationships between them. The ERD helps in understanding the data flow and interactions within the system.

### II. GUI Design

The GUI design of the Invoice Generator application focuses on user-friendly interfaces that facilitate easy navigation and data entry. Below are actual screenshots of the application's user interface, showcasing the layout and design of different screens:

- **Main Dashboard**: Displays an overview of the application features and recent activities.
- **Invoice Form**: Allows users to enter and manage invoice details.
- **Packaging List Form**: Provides fields for entering packaging information.
- **Annexure Form**: Enables the addition of supplementary information for shipments.
- **VGM Declaration**: Facilitates the entry of Verified Gross Mass details.

## Chapter 4: System Development

### Coding Standards

The development of the Invoice Generator application adheres to the following coding standards to ensure code quality and maintainability:

- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming conventions are used for variables, functions, and classes to enhance readability and understanding of the code.
- **Code Structure**: The code is organized into modules and components, following best practices for separation of concerns and reusability.
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and external documentation are provided to explain the functionality and logic of the code, aiding future developers in understanding and maintaining the application.

### Tools Explanation

The development of the Invoice Generator application utilizes a range of tools and technologies to streamline the development process:

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Visual Studio Code is used for code editing, debugging, and version control integration.
- **Version Control System**: Git is employed for tracking changes, collaborating with team members, and managing code versions.
- **Build Tools**: Vite is used for building and bundling the application, providing fast and efficient development workflows.
- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest and React Testing Library are used for unit and integration testing, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the application.

## Chapter 5: Testing

### Testing Strategy

The testing strategy for the Invoice Generator application involves a combination of manual and automated testing to ensure the application meets all functional and non-functional requirements. The strategy includes:

- **Unit Testing**: Focuses on individual components and functions to verify their correctness.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensures that different modules and components work together as expected.
- **System Testing**: Validates the complete and integrated application to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Involves end-users testing the application to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.

### Testing Methods

- **Automated Testing**: Utilizes tools like Jest and React Testing Library to automate unit and integration tests, ensuring consistent and repeatable test execution.
- **Manual Testing**: Involves exploratory testing by QA engineers to identify issues not covered by automated tests.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensures that new code changes do not adversely affect existing functionality.

### Test Cases

Test cases are designed to cover all critical functionalities of the application, including:

- **Form Validation**: Ensures that all form fields validate input correctly.
- **Data Persistence**: Verifies that data is saved and retrieved correctly from local storage.
- **Document Generation**: Confirms that PDF documents are generated accurately with the correct data.
- **User Interface**: Checks the responsiveness and usability of the application across different devices and browsers.

## Chapter 6: Conclusion

### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Automates the creation of export documents, reducing time and effort.
- **Accuracy**: Minimizes errors through validation and automated calculations.
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniformity across all documents.
- **User-Friendly**: Provides an intuitive interface that simplifies the document creation process.

### Limitations

- **Initial Setup Time**: Requires initial time investment to set up and configure the system.
- **Learning Curve**: Users may need some time to adapt to the new system, especially if they are accustomed to manual processes.
- **Dependency on Technology**: Relies on internet connectivity and modern web browsers for optimal performance.

### Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Analytics**: Implement analytics to provide insights into document processing times and error rates.
- **Mobile Support**: Enhance the application for better performance and usability on mobile devices.
- **Integration with ERP Systems**: Allow seamless integration with existing ERP systems for data synchronization.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Add support for multiple languages to cater to a broader user base.
